The Bank App Simulation is a Java-based application that emulates key functionalities of a typical bank's operations, aimed at providing an interface for both customers and banking personnel. The core functionalities include customer and account management, transaction processing, and banking operations like deposit, withdrawal, and transfers.

Transaction History: View a detailed transaction history for a customer, logging all banking operations they've performed.

User Interface: Interactive console-based menu for users to select and perform banking operations. Clear prompts and feedback for every action.

Testing: Comprehensive unit tests using JUnit 5, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the banking functions.

Future Enhancements (Optional): Introduction of a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience. Integration with a database system for persistent data storage. Enhanced security features such as password protection for accounts and encryption of transaction details.

Installation & Usage: Clone the repository to your local machine. Ensure you have Java installed and compile the source files. Run the centralBankApp main class to start the application. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform banking operations.
